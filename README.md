# Oh My Veggies!
India is the second largest producer of fruits after China. Due to the lack of skilled workers, 30â€“35% of the harvested fruits is wasted. With increased high quality expectations in food products, the need for authentic and objective quality determination in food products progress continuously. In general farmers and distributors  so manual quality inspection. But isn't this time consuming and laborious? 

So we thought of a more consistent and speedy method. Making use of Java and Machine learning techniques, we developed an android application called "Oh My Veggies" which recognises the fruit you point your camera to and notifies about the Name, Calorie content and whether its fresh or rotten.
